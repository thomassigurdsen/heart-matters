Mac OSX
-------

### Disclaimer:
Before we begin, This game has to my knowledge not been tested or ran on Mac
OSX. That said, python is an interpreted language. That means it should run
quite similarly on anything running python and pygame.

There may be other better ways of installing python and pygame.

### Instructions:
Now, pygame is not allways updated for the latest version of python, so check
which version of python you need, and download the pygame dmg:
http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

Then download and install the a correct python version:
http://python.org/download/

At last install pygame and run the game.

Installing and Running
======================

The game should run by double clicking it, or run it in a terminal with
'python ./heart-matters.py'.

If none of these work:
 * Do you have python properly installed?
 * Do you have permission to execute the file?
