### The DEBUG flag, change it to change level of debug info:
## 0: No debug info[1]
## 1: First level of debug messages, should only print information
## relevant to what is being worked on.
## 2: Second level debug, this is where almost all messages live.
## 3: Third level debug, this is for verbose or frequently repeated
## debug messages.
##
## [1]: This will not be true until the debug flag has been implemented
## project wide.
